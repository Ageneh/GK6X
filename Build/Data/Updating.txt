NOTE: Since V6.0.0.6 (2019-04-23) they have had a release schedule about 1-2 times a month.

0.json <---- contains keys.json ("mode-layer-temp-switch")
index.html
index.js <---- contains lang data ("macro_cate_already_exist")
manifest.js
vendor.js

- Download the official software
- Format the above files (0.json / index.js) and use them to update the following:

- Find string such as "macro_cate_already_exist" and update /Build/Data/i18n/langs/zh.jon/en.json
- Update keys.json by searching for "mode-layer-temp-switch"
- Copy all files from /driver/device/ to /Build/Data/device/ (rename the chinese named folder)
- In Program.cs call CMFile.DumpLighting() with "/driver/res/data/le/" as the path. Copy the dumped files from the created "dump" folder.
- Use https://jsonformatter.curiousconcept.com/ where applicable to fix up quotation marks on files (lang, keys.json is a manual fix)
